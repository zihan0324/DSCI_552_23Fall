# Homework 5
## Accute Inflamations Date
1. Build a decision tree
2. Convert the decision rules into a set of IF-THEN rules
3. Use cost-complexity pruning to find a minimal decision tree and a set of decision rules with high interpretability.

## Communities and Crime Data
1. Data imputation to deal with missing data
2. Plot a correlation matrix for the features in the data set
3. Pick $\lfloor 128 \rfloor$ features with highest CV
4. Fit a linear model using least squares to the training set and report the test error
5. Fit a ridge regression model on the training set, with λ chosen by cross-validation
6. Fit a LASSO model on the training set, with λ chosen by cross-validation
7. Fit a PCR model on the training set, with M (the number of principal compo- nents) chosen by cross-validation
8. Fit a boosting tree to the data. Determine α (the regularization term) using cross-validation
