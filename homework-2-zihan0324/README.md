## Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set
1. Explore the data
2. Fit a simple linear regression model
3. Fit a multiple regression model
4. Fit a non-linear model as follow:
$Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \beta_3 X^3 + \epsilon\$
5. Fit a full linear regression model with all pairwise interaction terms
6. Train the regression model on a randomly selected 70% subset of the data with all predictors
